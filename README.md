Optimizing Neural Network Training and Digit Generation using GMM and Activation Function Analysis

Project Explanation and Skill Showcase

In this project, I trained a custom neural network alongside Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to generate synthetic handwritten digits and classify them with the trained NN. The project demonstrates a strong understanding of Python, machine learning, and neural networks. 


Project Interest

The synthesis and classification of handwritten digits offer an engaging challenge by combining generative modeling (GMM) and neural network classification. It required an integrated approach to data generation, model training, and iterative validationâ€”highlighting essential skills for a data science or machine learning role, including problem-solving and adaptability across different algorithmic approaches.
